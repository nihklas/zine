|    WARNING: THIS IS A DEBUG BUILD OF ZINE     |
|-----------------------------------------------|
| Debug builds enable expensive sanity checks   |
| that reduce performance.                      |
|                                               |
| To create a release build, run:               |
|                                               |
|           zig build --release=fast            |
|                                               |
| If you're investigating a bug in Zine, then a |
| debug build might turn confusing behavior     |
| into a crash.                                 |
|                                               |
| To disable all forms of concurrency, you can  |
| add the following flag to your build command: |
|                                               |
|              -Dsingle-threaded                |
|                                               |
